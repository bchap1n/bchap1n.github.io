# work is fun
Building systems, and automating things is fun for me. So, in 2007 when a friend suggested I take a break from being a starving musician to take a 3-month contract job doing Windows desktop migrations, I said OK. Two years later I was a full-time sysadmin and heard about how something called Powershell was going to make my life a lot _more_ fun. I started converting my .bat and .vbs tools into powershell, and soon building custom reports, software installations, compliance checks, and other tools became easier to share and reuse with my team.

A few years later I began hearing about something called [DevOps][DevOps-talk] and how this was also going to be fun. I started putting my configurations and scripts into a private GitLab repository. I started writing tests for my code, and using tools like Pester, Vagrant, Chef, and Boxstarter. I built my first Chocolatey/NuGet package (Intune) using a myget repo . I began building a few systems in the Azure cloud and using cloud services like Intune, Office365, Power BI, Slack, Teams, etc. I started working with CentOS, Debian, and Ubuntu systems and learning basic Linux system administration and shell script. 

## mac's are fun too
In the Fall of 2016 my company finally gave up on managing their macbooks with SCCM, and asked my team to find a better way. This was the beginning of my relationship with JAMF and learning to love my Mac. We built a solid management system using JAMF Pro, Apple DEP, and Apple Enterprise Connect. JAMF has an awesome API and web based console which puts SCCM to shame. Doing rockstar level provisioning, automation, and reporting is simple. MacOS even has a good package management system available in [Homebrew Cask](https://github.com/caskroom/homebrew-cask/blob/master/README.md) that makes it easy to set up my mac, and of course I can use it to install Powershell-core and visual-studio-code!

## other fun stuff I do
I love electric guitar and play in a bay area rock'n'roll band called [Chains of the Skyway][band]. I go out to see live music, listen to a lot of music, [and I used to blog about it][getsortedsf]. I am married to the wonderful [@jewelzdell](https://twitter.com/jewelzdell), and we have two young boys. I also have a two really cool dogs, and about 20 chickens.
