Back in 2007 I was getting tired of spending all my time making music and being poor, so it wasn't hard for my buddy to convince me to take a 3 month contract job doing a Windows desktop migration. Two years later I was a full-time sysadmin and heard about how something called Powershell was going to make my life a lot easier. Well I like easy, so I got to work on converting my .bat and .vbs tools into powershell and it was fun. 

A few years later I began hearing about something called DevOps and how this was also going to make my life easier. I started putting my configurations and scripts into a private GitLab repository. I started writing tests for my code, and using tools like Pester, Vagrant, Chef, and Boxstarter. I built my first Chocolatey/NuGet package using a private repo (corporate intune installer). Heck, I even built a few things in the Azure cloud. 

In the Fall of 2016 my company finally gave up on managing their macbooks with SCCM, and asked my team to find a better way. This was the beginning of my relationship with JAMF and learning to love my Mac. We built a great management system using JAMF, Apple DEP, and Apple Enterprise Connect. The users loved it because it made using their mac at work easier. I love it because of it's awesome web based console and great API. I love it because doing rockstar level stuff is usually just extension attributes, configuration profiles, or simple API scripts. I like easy remember?
