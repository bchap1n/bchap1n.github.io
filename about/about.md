# work is fun
Building systems, and automating things is fun for me. So when I was getting tired of being a starving musician, it wasn't so hard for a friend to convince me to take a 3 month contract job doing a Windows desktop migration. Two years later I was a full-time sysadmin and heard about how something called Powershell was going to make my life a lot more fun. Well I like fun, so I got to work on converting my .bat and .vbs tools into powershell and it was fun. Building custom reports, software installations, compliance checks, and other tools got more fun and easier to share and reuse with my team.

A few years later I began hearing about something called DevOps and how this was also going to make my life more fun. I started putting my configurations and scripts into a private GitLab repository. I started writing tests for my code, and using tools like Pester, Vagrant, Chef, and Boxstarter. I built my first Chocolatey/NuGet package using a private myget repo (corporate intune installer). I began building a few systems in the Azure cloud and using cloud services like Intune, Office365, Power BI, Slack, Teams, etc. I started working with CentOS, Debian, and Ubuntu systems and learning basic Linux system administration and shell script. 

In the Fall of 2016 my company finally gave up on managing their macbooks with SCCM, and asked my team to find a better way. This was the beginning of my relationship with JAMF and learning to love my Mac. We built a great management system using JAMF Pro, Apple DEP, and Apple Enterprise Connect. The users loved it because it made using their mac at work easier. I love JAMF because of it's awesome web based console and great API. I love it because doing rockstar level stuff is usually just extension attributes, configuration profiles, or simple API scripts. 

# other fun stuff I do
I love electric guitar and I still play in a bay area rock'n'roll band. I go out to see live music, listen to a lot of music, and I like to talk about it. I am married and have two young boys and we love to watch baseball together.
